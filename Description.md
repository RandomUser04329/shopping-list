This mini project is based on a prompt that was given from the mdn web docs
site. The code was solely written by me and all was thought out with the assistance of seearching on google for help or better understanding. 

To use the shopping list, open the shopping-list.html file using terminal (or powershell) and it should then lead you to your web browser with the shopping list maker!

Its a simple project, nothing too crazy or appealing but it helped me practiced using the DOM parts of Javascript but also was a refresher for CSS and html code.

Enjoy and throw some comments about the code!
